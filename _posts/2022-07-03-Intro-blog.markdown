Welcome to my personal channel! I have promised to make a personal github page for long time and finally I launch this. I have two primary motivation. The first is to use it as my C.V., a self-intro, posting my math, code, and thinkings. "Talk is cheap, show me the math/code". The second is to motivate myself to continue learning, make sure my brain is always updated. 
Thank you for reading, and hope my post could interest you. Have a nice day :)
